**Title** : Applying Data Science and Machine Learning using Microsoft .Net 

**Event**: Cloud Lunch and Learn

**Organizer**: Hugo Barona

**Session Date and Time:** 08/03//20120 01:00 PM Irish Standard Time(GMT +1)

Data Science and Machine learning are not only for python and R developers. If you are a .NET developer and interested in the above topics, don't let your creativity take a hit. Let it flourish by leveraging some of the cool frameworks and libraries developed by the .NET team in the past 1-2 years. In this session, I'll perform exploratory data analysis on the COVID-19 dataset using DataFrame API followed by prediction using ML.NET time series API. It'll be an example-driven session.
