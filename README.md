# Cloud Lunch and Learn

This repository is a container to store all materials related to Cloud Lunch and Learn sessions - <https://bit.ly/2K1Rcag>.
Every week we will have one or more speakers talking about Azure and providing materials so you can practice and learn. All materials will be stored in this repository.

## Sessions

Everyone is welcome to contribute to this initiative, so if you have any topic that you would like to talk about it, please contact me and we can schedule your session. In case you have not so much experience delivering online sessions, that is not a problem as well. We can provide you guidance to help you deliver your session.
